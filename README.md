My exercises for the Harvard University Introduction to Computer Science Course: CS50 Week 1 - C

Mario Less: 
Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks. This prgram recreates the pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks. The user inputs how tall the pyramid should be via prompt.

Mario More:
Same as above. However this time, the program recreates adjacent pyramids of blocks with a space in between.

Cash:
A program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then uses a greddy algorithm to print the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made. 

Credit:
A program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid, according to Luhn’s algorithm.
